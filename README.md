This contais the assignments from Computer Graphics 2014.1, done in WebGL with Three.js

The purpose was to create a robot hand in 3D, that could move it's fingers.

A live demo can be see here: http://thiagoponte.orgfree.com

*In the first part, a 3D hand with five fingers should be drawn in the browser.
It must be built with vertices and faces.

*In part 2, the hand has to close-rotate the fingers-using the keyboard. In this case, F close, and R open.

*In part 3, the fingers have all 3 phalanges. The manipulation is done through a GUI instead of keyboard.

*In part 4, texture and lighting is added. This is the complete program.

*To see it in action, you need a http server running local.
